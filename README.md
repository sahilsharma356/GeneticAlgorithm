# GeneticAlgorithm

This algorithm generates random dots which travel in random directions. The objective is that through random events the dots will "learn"
to travel towards the set target. Through mutations each generations takes the best from past generations and tries to complete the objective
in less moves. 

The processing development tool was used to code this as the built in functions make it very easy to make the GUI and animate the dots. 

Processing can be found here:

for the magic :)
